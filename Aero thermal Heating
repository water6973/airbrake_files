#This code works for a pi when uploaded via SSH or terminal onbaord the comuter. It will export the timestamp and tempature every second to a file stored onboard the SD card. 
#It assumes the use of a DS18B20 heat sensor but different packages can be uploaded for different sensor models. 

#Run Commands from terminal or SSH remotley onto pi to get the packages

#  sudo apt install python3-pip -y
#  pip3 install w1thermsensor

#Open a text editor in the shell by using : nano log_temp.py



#Now copy and paste the code into it.



from w1thermsensor import W1ThermSensor
import time

sensor = W1ThermSensor()

with open("temperature_log.csv", "a") as file:
    file.write("Timestamp,Temperature (°C)\n")

while True:
    timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    temperature = sensor.get_temperature()

    print(f"{timestamp} - Temperature: {temperature:.2f}°C")

    with open("temperature_log.csv", "a") as file:
        file.write(f"{timestamp},{temperature:.2f}\n")

    time.sleep(1)



#save by doing CTR X, y, and enter, not all at the same time.




#To make run on startup

# crontab -e

#Add this line at bottom : @reboot python3 /home/pi/log_temp.py &

# Easy
